# Basic Student Record System - C Implementation

A simple **Student Record Management System** implemented in C. This program allows users to **add, update, delete, and view student records** in a structured manner. All student details are automatically saved to a file (`student_records.txt`) to prevent data loss.

## 🎮 Features:
1. **Add Student** - Input student details like Roll Number, Name, DOB, Mobile Number, and School ID.
2. **Update Student** - Modify any student's details using their School ID.
3. **Delete Student** - Remove a student's record permanently.
4. **View All Students** - Display the list of all stored student records.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **C Programming**
- **Structured Data Management** (using `struct`)
- **Loops & Conditional Statements**

## 🚀 Getting Started:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShadBuilds/Basic_Sudent_record_system
```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

```bash
cd Basic_Sudent_record_system
```

3. **Compile the program using GCC:**

```bash
gcc sbasic_prg_for-Student_records.c -o basic_prg_for-Student_records
```

4. **Run the program:**

```bash
./basic_prg_for-Student_records
```

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works:
1. The program provides a **menu-driven interface** to manage student records.
2. Users can **add, modify, delete, or view** student data easily.

### Example Output:
```
--- Basic Student Record System ---
1 - Add Student
2 - Delete Student
3 - Update Student
4 - Print All Students
5 - Exit

## 📚 What I Learned:
- **Using `struct` for efficient data organization.**
- **Dynamic student management with add, update, and delete operations.**
- **Efficient use of loops and conditional logic for user-friendly interaction.**
